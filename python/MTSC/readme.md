Dataset `EEGEyeState.txt`  records some EEG data observed by 14 sensors in the top 14 columns. The last column is a binary value corresponding to Eye Status (open or closed). Each row of data is a record of the 14 sensors and Eye Status at a time.

TDA, CNN and RNN-with-LSTM are used to predict Eye Status.
